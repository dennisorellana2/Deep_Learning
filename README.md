# Deep_Learning

An Academic Assignment on Deep Learning.

## Code and Resources Used

Python Version: 3.8
Packages: tensorflow, matplotlib

CIFAR-10 dataset:https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Model Building 
I developed two convolutional neural networks  models:
* The first convolutional neural networks model with eight layers
* The second convolutional neural networks model with nine layers

## Model Performance
* The accuracy result for model one is 71.67%.
