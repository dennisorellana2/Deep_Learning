## Model Building 
I developed two convolutional neural networks  models:
* The first convolutional neural networks model with eight layers
* The second convolutional neural networks model with nine layers

## Model Performance
* The accuracy result for model one is 71.67%.

## Overall 

In conclusion, the best convolutional neural networks model between the two is model one based on the 71.67% accuracy.
